This code was written for a research on duplicate detection algorithms for the course Computer Science for Business Analytics of the Business Analytics and Quantitative Marketing master at Erasmus Scool of Economics. The goal of this research was to compare a duplicate detection method based on hierarchical clustering with a similar method based on minimum spanning tree clustering.

We have implemented methods for the extraction of model words, creating binary product vectors based on these model words, minHashing, linear sensitivity hashing, hierarchical and minimum spanning tree clustering based on Jaccard dissimilarity values (1- Jaccard similarity). The methods are written in a function and at the end of the code we run all methods for training and test cases. The data used for this research consists of product descriptions of various websites and is cleaned at the beginning of the code.
